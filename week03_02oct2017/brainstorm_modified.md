# Part 1 - Brainstorm: Statistics

## Distributions
### e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, ..

## Statistical Models
## Methods for Estimation
## Methods for Hypothesis Testing

# Part 2 - Brainstorm: Technologies in Biology

## microarray, sequencing, etc.

## In-class exercise 1 (1 technology for each row): microarray, Illumina sequencing, 3rd generation sequencing, cytometry, mass spectrometry

### Goal: 
#### produce a 2-3 point summary
#### links to a few (<5) good resources
#### create a markdown file for it; we will try a "group assignment" via GitHub

# Part 3 - Brainstorm: Applications in genomics 

### e.g., gene expression

# Part 4 - Brainstorm: Linking Technologies to Applications to Statistics (mainstream)

## e.g., microarray -> gene expression -> normally distributed (log intensities)

## In-class exercise 2 (in groups/rows): 
### Goal: make the link between technologies, what is measured, statistical models used
### For example:
##### RNA-seq: sequencing -> gene expression -> ?
##### BS-seq: bisulphite + sequencing -> DNA methylation -> ?
##### ChIP-seq: sequencing -> protein/DNA interactions -> ?

# Part 5 - Brainstorm: Methods/algorithms/data structures that are associated more to computer science

### Part 6: Microarrays

## Background and application 

A microarray is the convergence of DNA hybridization, fluorescence microscopy, and solid surface DNA capture. The setup consists of DNA oligonucleotide probes which are immobilized on a solid surface and capture the complementary sequences contained in the sample. The two main applications of this technology are the quantification of gene expression and the detection of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) between samples. 
 
## Technology -> application -> statistics
* Technology: Microarray
* Application: Testing if expression profiles between samples differ for selected genes.
* Statistics: Sum of squared univariate t-statistics, number of genes univariately significant at Î± level.
